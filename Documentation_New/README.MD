# Documentation New

This directory contains a new documentation, build from zero. We aim to document the entire code. Including our changes, already existing code, and everything else.

This is being done by the Aeplo Foundation. Aeplo is a cloud-compute company, also transitioning to traditional operating-system development. The Linux source code
is an amazing start. We use it to start our study, make changes, and eventually create our own Kernel using it. Regardless our changes, we will always keep the source-code
open-source. Everyone is free to access it.
